I WAS doing a desgining about a car website so I choose cars for my "Interactive Gallery", however they have different colors and styles compare with those photos I already have, so it not a copy paste pictures.

I have to open like 50 tabs to find what I need and when I find it, it not what I want, I have to rewrite the code so many times to figure out that the mistake is only 1 line for every single time. 

The hardest part for me is finding the pictures and try to make the background become black, even it is so simple, with just 1 code but there is something that block that code so it is very frustrated to find the problem.

Not required means I still can use it right? Instruction unclear
